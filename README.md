Ursina 3D Projects - Tasks 1 to 3

This repository contains 3 projects built using Ursina Engine in Python.  
Each project demonstrates different levels of 3D programming, from simple objects to interactive worlds.

Task 1 – Beginner: Rotating Cube
Description:
A simple 3D scene with a cube that continuously rotates.

Features:
- Rotating cube in a 3D space.
- Camera is fixed, showing the cube.

Code file: task1.py

Controls:  
- No controls; cube rotates automatically.


Task 2 – Intermediate: Interactive Player Scene
Description:
- Player cube can move around a 3D environment.
- Includes an interactive cube that changes color when touched.
Features: 
- Player movement using W/A/S/D keys.
- Interactive cube changes color when touched by player.
- Camera follows the player (third-person view).

Code file: task2.py

Controls:  
- W/A/S/D → Move player.
- Touching the cube → cube changes color.


Task 3 – Advanced: Immersive 3D Scene

Description: 
- Extends Task 2 with multiple interactive objects.
- Includes a magical gate (door) and a rotating cube.

Features:
- Player movement with W/A/S/D.  
- Door:
  - Press **E** near it → disappears (opens).  
  - Press **Q** near it → reappears (closes).  
- Rotating cube rotates when touched.  
- Basic lighting: directional and ambient lights.  
- Camera follows player.

Code file: task3.py

Controls:  
- W/A/S/D → Move player  
- E → Open door (disappear)  
- Q → Close door (reappear)
